the climb is straightforward, but there is one fairly steep section on 40 to 55
degree snow where belaying is necessary.
The route is approached on the trail across the Ganja La, the tricky but
direct pass from Langtang to Helambu. The climb is often incorporated into a
crossing of the pass and can be done with two camps. The first is Ganja La
base camp some 500 meters above Kyanjin Gompa and the second a high
camp at around 4,900 meters. The summit offers sublime views of the peaks

and route finding difficulty – there is no obvious ‘standard’ line up and is best
tackled in true expedition style.
Even though it offers new route potential, it has received little attention from
mountaineers and is rarely climbed. The most common approaches are via
the Southeast Face or Northwest Face though the latter is seldom attempted.
Hiunchuli’s eastern face overlooks the Modi Khola and guards the entrance
to the Annapurna Sanctuary. An American Peace Corps Expedition first
climbed Hiunchuli in October 1971 via the Southeast Face.

It is taken as the high trekking peaks on the Southern ridge and is part of the longest range the Mahalangur Range. 
Kyazo Ri (6,186 m) is situated in the Khumbu Himal just north of Namche
Bazaar. It is the highest summit of a long line of peaks that separate the
Thame Valley to the west and Gokyo Valley to the east and run all the way to
Cho Oyu on the Nepal-Tibet border.
This is a classic trekking peak, seldom climbed, with a wonderfully isolated
base camp. It’s technically pleasing for experienced climbers and the summit
day’s climbing has been compared to that of Ama Dablam, though at only
6,186 m it requires much less acclimatization (and therefore time to do). The normal route is south-facing, catching the sun, and has few objective
hazards such as rockfall or avalanche.
Basecamp is in a pristine, hidden valley known as the Kyajo Drangka, which
requires a long hike to reach it from Mende, about 4 km from Namche
Bazaar. See the fourth edition of the guide book “Trekking in the Everest
Region” for a description.
Reaching Camp 1 from Base Camp is a long day over rough, but non-
technical terrain. Camp 2 is a shorter distance from Camp 1 but the terrain
includes difficult scree and giant boulders. From Camp 2 to the summit is 12
pitches of steep snow and ice, most of which require belaying, with one or
two steep pitches of up to 65° gradient just below the summit.",Province 1,Solukhumbu,Khumbu Pasang Lhamu,Mahalangur,Sp 4000 (NRs),Sp 250 (USD)

It has a north-by-northwest ridge, which rises from the crevassed glacier

by crevasse and seracs. The lower reaches pose little difficulty, although
towards the summit, depending on seasonal conditions, open crevasses and
ice-steps may present some challenges.

POKA,POKA,,Pokalde,Dolma Ri,27.924711,86.833132,,,,,,"Pokalde Peak (or Dolma Ri) is a mountain peak of Nepal situated 12 km southwest of Mount Everest. Pokalde Peak is one of the shortest and easiest trekking peaks in the Everest Region. The majority of the 650m climb from base camp requires little more than walking with short sections of scrambling up rock.During the trekking seasons this rocky peak is scarcely covered by snow. Despite its lack of any great technical difficulty, it offers trekkers the prospect of reaching 5,800m in elevation and superb views from the summit, particularly to the South East, North West and West. Other prominent mountains visible from the summit include Makalu, Ama Dablam and Pumori. Because of its relatively low difficulty and impressive summit vista's for this altitude, Pokalde is a popular commercial tourist peak in Nepal for those wishing to climb a Himalayan peak without needing to use ice axes and crampons.The first ascent of Pokalde Peak was made in April 1953 via the ridge adjoining the Pokalde summit with the Kongma La high pass (5535m). This ridge continues from Kongma La to the slightly higher Mehra Peak (Kongma Tse) at 5820m and beyond. Hence the prominence of Pokalde Peak is modest at 271m (889 feet). Most ascents of Pokalde Peak nowadays are made by skirting the opposite Makalu side of the mountain.Pokalde Peak can be easily climbed in half a day by a fit and acclimatised group with appropriate leadership. Despite its low difficulty, sections of Pokalde are quite exposed so it shouldn't be attempted in poor weather. Doing so would significantly increase the difficulty of the climb above that of a ""simple trekking peak"". The final pitch to the summit also involves a short section of near vertical scrambling which for amateurs should definitely be protected by rope.The base camp of Pokalde Peak is situated in a raised ""amphitheatre"" style valley with a large circular lake in the middle below the Kongma La pass. About 40 minutes from the base camp is the Kongma glacier. This glacier offers ice walls suitable for ice climbing training by appropriately equipped and motivated groups. The glacier is said to be receding in size.Footprint evidence of significant snow leopard activity has been witnessed in the vicinity of Pokalde Peak base camp. This is despite the popularity of the area in being the gateway to both a major trekking peak as well as a high pass.Even during the trekking seasons, it is not uncommon for overnight temperatures at base camp to be in excess of twenty degrees below freezing.By elevation Pokalde is# 67 out of 83 in Sagarmatha National Park# 82 out of 99 in SolukhumbuBy prominence Pokalde is# 43 out of 83 in Sagarmatha National Park# 85 out of 212 in Eastern Development Region# 56 out of 99 in Solukhumbu",Province 1,Solukhumbu/NC,,,,

The trek into Rolwaling adds to the attraction of these peaks. It is much less
frequently visited than the Khumbu region and is a secretive valley which
twists and turns, with views restricted by steep forested cliffs, until the valley
opens up to superb Himalayan mountain scenery.
The straightforward normal route up the North East Face of the icy dome of
Ramdung is long and usually requires two camps for proper acclimatisation.
Basecamp is positioned below the Yalung La (5,310 m), and nearby Yalung
Peak (5,650 m) is an ideal acclimatisation climb. A spectacular high camp is
normally located on the glacier below the summit ridge.

common Tibetan name, Chomolungma, meaning “Goddess Mother of the
World” or “Goddess of the Valley.” The Sanskrit or Nepali name
“Sagarmatha” literally means “Peak of Heaven.” Its identity as the highest
point on the Earth’s surface was not recognized until 1852. The fact was
revealed by the governmental Survey of India in 1852. In 1865, the mountain
referred to as Peak XV was renamed as Mount Everest in honour of Sir
George Everest, the British surveyor general of India from 1830 to 1843.
Mount Everest is part of the longest Himalayan range, Mahalangur range, of
the Nepal Himalayas. It is at an elevation of 8,848 m in Khumjung Village
Development Committee under Khumbu Pasang Lhamu rural municipality in
Solukhumbu District in Eastern Development Region of Nepal. It is open for
expeditions. It takes approximately 84 days to summit the peak. A flight to
Lukla is the entry point for Sagarmatha. Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing
Norgay Sherpa were the first to ascent the highest peak on May 29, 1953.
The caravan route for Sagarmatha begins from Lukla to Jorsalle to Namche to
Khumjung to Pheriche to Lobuche to Gorakshep and finally to the Base Camp.
The total distance of the caravan route through Pheriche is 51.2 km. The total
climbing route is 11.2 km. The nearest settlement to Sagarmatha is Lobuche at
a distance of 8.3 km. The nearest police post and army post are at Namche at a
distance of 34.1 km. The nearest health post is located at Pheriche which is
51.2 km from Sagarmatha. The nearest tourist post to the peak is situated at
