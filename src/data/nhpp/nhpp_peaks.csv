common Tibetan name, Chomolungma, meaning “Goddess Mother of the
World” or “Goddess of the Valley.” The Sanskrit or Nepali name
“Sagarmatha” literally means “Peak of Heaven.” Its identity as the highest
point on the Earth’s surface was not recognized until 1852. The fact was
revealed by the governmental Survey of India in 1852. In 1865, the mountain
referred to as Peak XV was renamed as Mount Everest in honour of Sir
George Everest, the British surveyor general of India from 1830 to 1843.
Mount Everest is part of the longest Himalayan range, Mahalangur range, of
the Nepal Himalayas. It is at an elevation of 8,848 m in Khumjung Village
Development Committee under Khumbu Pasang Lhamu rural municipality in
Solukhumbu District in Eastern Development Region of Nepal. It is open for
expeditions. It takes approximately 84 days to summit the peak. A flight to
Lukla is the entry point for Sagarmatha. Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing
Norgay Sherpa were the first to ascent the highest peak on May 29, 1953.
The caravan route for Sagarmatha begins from Lukla to Jorsalle to Namche to
Khumjung to Pheriche to Lobuche to Gorakshep and finally to the Base Camp.

the  Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 came to the conclusion that

Trek. The approach to base camp is from the village of Manang. The common
route to the summit is via the North-East Ridge which was climbed in 1955
by a German expedition.
Chulu East is situated high above the Manang valley with breathtaking
views across to the Annapurnas II, III and IV, Gangapurna, Glacier Dome,
Dhaulagiri, Tilicho Peak and Manaslu.
Chulu East requires previous alpine experience with crossings of fractured
glacial terrain and steep scree slopes to gain the main high summit ridge.
There is a second peak on the Chulu East permit called Chulu Far East
(6,060 m) which guide Jamie McGuinness states “should be the ‘Island Peak’ of the Annapurnas, straightforward yet fun.” Both peaks share the same base
camp. Note that groups often climb Chulu Far East instead of Chulu East.
Beyond the common ridge route, there is also a route that climbs the East
Ridge (AD+) which requires a high camp, and a route that ascends the South
East Ridge (D). Both require different base camps.",Gandaki Pradesh,Manang,Nesyang/Nar,Damodar,Sp 5000 (NRs),Sp 400 (USD)

and route finding difficulty – there is no obvious ‘standard’ line up and is best
tackled in true expedition style.
Even though it offers new route potential, it has received little attention from
mountaineers and is rarely climbed. The most common approaches are via
the Southeast Face or Northwest Face though the latter is seldom attempted.
Hiunchuli’s eastern face overlooks the Modi Khola and guards the entrance
to the Annapurna Sanctuary. An American Peace Corps Expedition first
climbed Hiunchuli in October 1971 via the Southeast Face.

It has a north-by-northwest ridge, which rises from the crevassed glacier
astride the Tashi Lapcha. The face of the ridge forms a uniform slope broken
by crevasse and seracs. The lower reaches pose little difficulty, although
towards the summit, depending on seasonal conditions, open crevasses and
ice-steps may present some challenges.

It is taken as the high trekking peaks on the Southern ridge and is part of the longest range the Mahalangur Range. 
Kyazo Ri (6,186 m) is situated in the Khumbu Himal just north of Namche
Bazaar. It is the highest summit of a long line of peaks that separate the
Thame Valley to the west and Gokyo Valley to the east and run all the way to
Cho Oyu on the Nepal-Tibet border.
This is a classic trekking peak, seldom climbed, with a wonderfully isolated
base camp. It’s technically pleasing for experienced climbers and the summit
day’s climbing has been compared to that of Ama Dablam, though at only
6,186 m it requires much less acclimatization (and therefore time to do). The normal route is south-facing, catching the sun, and has few objective
hazards such as rockfall or avalanche.
Basecamp is in a pristine, hidden valley known as the Kyajo Drangka, which
requires a long hike to reach it from Mende, about 4 km from Namche
Bazaar. See the fourth edition of the guide book “Trekking in the Everest
Region” for a description.
Reaching Camp 1 from Base Camp is a long day over rough, but non-
technical terrain. Camp 2 is a shorter distance from Camp 1 but the terrain
includes difficult scree and giant boulders. From Camp 2 to the summit is 12
pitches of steep snow and ice, most of which require belaying, with one or
two steep pitches of up to 65° gradient just below the summit.",Province 1,Solukhumbu,Khumbu Pasang Lhamu,Mahalangur,Sp 4000 (NRs),Sp 250 (USD)

pass (5,760m).
The trek into Rolwaling adds to the attraction of these peaks. It is much less
frequently visited than the Khumbu region and is a secretive valley which
twists and turns, with views restricted by steep forested cliffs, until the valley
opens up to superb Himalayan mountain scenery.
The straightforward normal route up the North East Face of the icy dome of
Ramdung is long and usually requires two camps for proper acclimatisation.
Basecamp is positioned below the Yalung La (5,310 m), and nearby Yalung
Peak (5,650 m) is an ideal acclimatisation climb. A spectacular high camp is
normally located on the glacier below the summit ridge.

degree snow where belaying is necessary.
The route is approached on the trail across the Ganja La, the tricky but
direct pass from Langtang to Helambu. The climb is often incorporated into a
crossing of the pass and can be done with two camps. The first is Ganja La
base camp some 500 meters above Kyanjin Gompa and the second a high
camp at around 4,900 meters. The summit offers sublime views of the peaks
